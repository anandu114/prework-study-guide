# prework-study-guide

## A study guide for course pre-work.

- The main motivation behind learning Front end Web development couse is to updgrade my career. I'm a QA automation engineer and my current skills include automating front end and back end API's. I have confidence that after completing this course, I will be more confident in my current role as well as will get more carrer options and I even think of switching to a front end developer role if i'm confident enough.

- I build this project to learn the basics of HTML, CSS annd Javascript that forms the buidling block of a web page. Also to get familarised with Git and   Github and the best practices followed in web development.
- Building my first website solved the problem of fear. I was afraid to learn wed development thinking i'm not suitable for the roles but after reading   the pre-work modules, i have confidence that I can do this :)
- I learnt the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript by developing this website
